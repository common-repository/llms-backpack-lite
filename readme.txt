== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<b>Does this plugin work with any LMS plugin?</b>
No. This plugin is designed to work only with LifterLMS.

<b>Does the premium version contain all these features?</b>
The premium version of this plugin contains most of these features (as of the time of this writting) and will actually contain more as sales grow.

Although I regularly update the premium plugin with small changes, every 20 purchases of the premium version = one new major feature added to LifterLMS BackPack.
The next major feature on the list is:
User Upload/Enrollment
A feature to upload students via CSV file.
The students will be assigned their instructor (any instructor, not just the course instructor)
Instructors will be able to be uploaded with or without a course assigned.
You can identify the access-plan(s) you want to enroll them into, and you can optionally set each students start date for the access-plan.
